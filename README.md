# PenguinMod-IntermediateBackendApi
Do not use PenguinMod-LegacyBackendApi anymore once this is completed. This version uses less resources & avoids Data URLs.

## Code
Yes code is really messy, a newer API is still in development that should have each endpoint in it's own small file instead of one large file.

## Contributing
uhh...
